# Fraud Detection Case Study

For the next two days we will work with the entire end to end pipeline of data science through a case study.  We have touched on aspects of this throughout the course but have not yet put all the pieces together.

Topics included in this case study include:
* Classification modeling.
* Programming Practice: Handing off models. 
* Teamwork.
* Web applications.
* Website hosting with AWS
* Deploying a DS application.
* Data visualization.
* Results presentation.

#### Rough timeline 

* Day 1: Project scoping, Team direction, Model building
* Day 2: Web app and deployment

#### Deliverables

We will want two deliverables from you for this project:

* A dashboard for investigators to use which helps them identify new events that are worthy of investigation for fraud.  This will pull in new data regularly, and update a useful display for the investigation team.  How you wish to lay this out is up to you.
* A ten-minute presentation on your process and results. 

#### Notes

* [Overview](overview.md): gives a detailed overview of the project.  Included are *suggestions* for how you can organize your team, though this is not binding, and you are free to deviate.
* [Building your model](model_notes.md): notes on how to get started with the dataset and how to save your model once you've trained it.
